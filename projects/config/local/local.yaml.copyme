# @package _global_

# Copy this file to a new file called `local.yaml`. In this file, you can override
# config parameters for your local environment without accidentally pushing them to git.
# Do NOT remove or change this file though, as it is git tracked.

# You can override any other config parameters, for example:
training:
  data_loaders:
    train:
      num_workers: 4
    val:
      num_workers: 4
